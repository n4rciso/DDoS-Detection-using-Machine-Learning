# DDoS-detection
The primary aim of this project is to detect and characterize Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques. By harnessing the power of ML, we intend to develop a robust system that not only identifies the presence of DDoS attacks but also understands their underlying characteristics and patterns.
